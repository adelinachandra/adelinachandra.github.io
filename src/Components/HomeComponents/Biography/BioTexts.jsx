            <p className='text-base mb-2 text-left'>I am an interdisciplinary researcher with backgrounds in Geography, Environmental Studies, and Sustainability Science, and Environmental Policy. My research focuses on issues surrounding sustainability, forestry and land-use practices, as well as sustainable commodity chains. Together with my colleagues, I am currently running a research project focusing on smallholder inclusion in forest-focused supply chain policy implementation in Indonesia. My recent publication assessed whether corporate sustainability policies and implementation on eliminating deforestation in the tropics align with the targetted aims.</p>
